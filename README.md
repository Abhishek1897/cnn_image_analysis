CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Overview This project focuses on implementing Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10
dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset in the field of computer
vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The goal
is to train a model that can accurately classify these images into their
respective categories.

Summary The project involves several key steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded, and basic
exploration is performed to understand its structure and content.

Preprocessing: The image data is normalized to ensure uniformity in
pixel values, and the labels are one-hot encoded to prepare them for
classification.

Model Building: A CNN architecture is designed using the Keras
framework, comprising convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout
layers, and fully connected layers. The model is compiled with
appropriate loss function and optimizer.

Training: The model is trained on the training dataset with different
combinations of batch sizes and epochs. Training progress is monitored,
and model performance is evaluated using the validation dataset.

Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess
its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.

Analysis: The results are analyzed to understand how different batch
sizes and epochs affect model performance. Insights are drawn regarding
trends in accuracy and loss across different training configurations.

Overall, the project demonstrates the process of building and training
CNNs for image classification tasks, providing valuable insights into
model performance and optimization strategies.
